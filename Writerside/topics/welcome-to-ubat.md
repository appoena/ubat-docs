## What is %product%

%product% is a cloud native application designed to reduce the cost associated with bad logging
practices like:


1. Incorrect output format
2. Logging unnecessary parts of the application
3. Bad coding practices related to logging


These are just a few of the problems that can be solved easily with the help of %product%.

With %product% you can identify code changes that deviate from the logging standards of your
organization, or help you create one that is consistent across applications and languages.

%product% also helps with:

1. Reducing the cost of your infrastructure due to reduced computational resource usage
2. Simplifying the troubleshooting of applications by identifying problems faster
3. Reducing logging events noise by logging only what you need
4. Validating compliance with GDPR and other privacy laws
